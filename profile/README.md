ACM Research is a semester-long program designed for students who want to dive deeper into a subfield of computer science and the process of conducting novel research. This semester, there will be ten unique research projects with a UTD faculty member advising each project. While ACM Research is open to all undergraduates of any major who are interested in researching in a technical field, underclassmen (freshmen and sophomores) are encouraged to join so they can build some experience during their time at UTD for future research and job opportunities. Each team has a unique topic to research, and there are multitudes of different niches to explore.

We will be developing a sentiment analysis model for detecting whether a movie review is positive or negative.
Specifically, we will be delving into Natural Language Processing (NLP) to construct a sentiment analysis model.
Our primary objective is to create a Neural Network that is capable of ascertaining whether a given movie review carries
a positive or negative sentiment so that we can unravel the intricate emotions embedded within movie reviews

Steganography is used to conceal information within plain sight, while Steganalysis is employed to reveal
this information. You will hide messages within images and then utilize various techniques to detect and unveil
the concealed content. Afterward, you will train a machine learning model to classify images that contain hidden information.

Decentralized applications have emerged as a transformative force in the world of blockchain technology, enabling transparent, secure,
and censorship-resistant interactions on a global scale. Among the emerging blockchain platforms, Solana stands out for its high-performance
capabilities and scalability, making it a promising foundation for building dApps that can handle complex tasks and accommodate growing
user demands. In this project, we delve into the exciting realm of decentralized applications on the Solana blockchain, exploring their
potential to revolutionize industries and reshape the way we engage with digital services. Through comprehensive analysis and hands-on
development, we aim to uncover Solana's unique features and advantages while addressing challenges and providing insights
into the future landscape of decentralized applications.

To assist forensics experts in identifying what events took place at the scene of a crime, you will
learn the basics of image classification and train a model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
to classify bloodstain patterns commonly found in crime scenes into three categories: passive, transfer, and impact.

### [Leveraging Explainable AI to Mitigate Bias in Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/ACM-Research/WristFractureYOLOv7-Public)
 <a href="#"><img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Rowan%20White-purple"> </a><a href="#"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Aaron%20Barthwal-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Khiem%20Nguyen-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Laya%20Srinivas-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ram%20Gudur-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sanya%20Oak-gray">
```
AI is often seen as less biased than humans, but it can inherit biases from human-curated data,
affecting its decisions. For example, biased hiring practices can lead AI to unfairly rank job resumes
based on names. AI's inner workings are often unclear, creating transparency issues. This project delves
into various AI models and how XAI can unveil their operations. As a team, you'll select a model and a
real-world issue to explore, then use XAI to examine and improve that model.

### [Scaffold: Breaking Down Complex Tasks with Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/ACM-Research/WristFractureYOLOv7-Public)
 <a href="#"><img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Naveen%20Mukkatt-purple"> </a><a href="#"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Elijah%20Walker-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Luigi%20Victorelli-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matthew%20Biji-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Renjit%20Joseph-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sophie%20Tran-gray">
```
Humans break down complex tasks into simpler steps, so what if we took the same approach towards
teaching AIs how to navigate their environment? In Scaffold, you will try to answer this question
by studying various reinforcement learning algorithms and applying them to AIs as they learn to navigate
their environment. The AI will be piloting a 3D character in a game engine, so if you have familiarity
with game design or Unity/Unreal (hi ATEC majors), you're an ideal fit!
