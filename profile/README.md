*this is a work in progress lol*

ACM Research is a semester-long program designed for students who want to dive deeper into a subfield of computer science and the process of conducting novel research. This semester, there will be ten unique research projects with a UTD faculty member advising each project. While ACM Research is open to all undergraduates of any major who are interested in researching in a technical field, underclassmen (freshmen and sophomores) are encouraged to join so they can build some experience during their time at UTD for future research and job opportunities. Each team has a unique topic to research, and there are multitudes of different niches to explore.

### [ROVer Optometry (œÅ): Underwater Object Detection](https://github.com/ACM-Research/ROVer-Optometry-Underwater-Object-Detection)
<a href="#"><img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Aarian%20Ahsan-purple"></a><a href="#"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan"  src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Aditya%20Kulkarni-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Farman%20Ali-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan"  src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Parisa%20Nawar-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sruti%20Karthikeyan-black">
```
You will learn the basics of image classification to then be immediately thrown into the ringer to train a model that
can detect certain types of objects under various measures of turbid water by utilizing CNNs 
(Convolutional neural networks) such as YOLO or MobileNet. The main goal is to be able to demonstrate underwater image 
classification at a high accuracy rate.

### [Baremetal Programming an embedded system to Manipulate Rigid bodies in 3D Euclidean Space](https://github.com/ACM-Research/Baremetal_Programming)
 <a href="#"><img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Adith%20Talupuru-purple"> </a><a href="#"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Michael%20Ugochukwu-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Omar%20Abioye-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pranay%20Lakkaraju-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Raj%20Thapa-black">
```
Computing the transformations of rigid bodies over 3 dimensions is a very intensive process. A lot of computers have quite 
a bit of difficulty doing it efficiently. It's the main reason graphics cards exist in the first place. Let's try making 
it work on an embedded device!

### [Cardiothoracic Diagnosis through Machine and Deep Learning](https://github.com/ACM-Research/CardiothoraciDiagnosisPublicRepository)
 <a href="#"><img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Aditya%20Desai-purple"> </a><a href="#"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Anish%20Nyalakonda-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Avinash%20Sriram-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Phillip%20Lee-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Shahrukh%20Showkath-black">
```
You will learn the basics of deep learning and data augmentation to develop a model that can accurately detect a wide range 
of diseases from a Chest X-Ray. Some diseases that will be focused on include: Pneumonia, COVID-19, Cardiomegaly, and a 
healthy thoracic cavity.

### [Colored Image Translation with CycleGAN](https://github.com/ACM-Research/Image-Transfer)
 <a href="#"><img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Benjamin%20Bowers-purple"> </a><a href="#"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Nivedh%20Koya-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ompranay%20Yedluri-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ryan%20Joseph-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Saanvi%20Bala-black">
```
Images that are used as training data for machine learning are often more effective if they use a specific color scheme, 
such as thermal coloring. Using CycleGAN, we will build a model that can convert a given photo from normal coloring to 
specific colorings that are more effective as training data.

### [DisinfoDeception: Using Adversarial Attacks to Deceive Political Disinformation Models on Twitter](https://github.com/ACM-Research/DisinfoDeception_public)
 <a href="#"><img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Christopher%20Back-purple"> </a><a href="#"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Jonathan%20Serrano-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Joseph%20Wright-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Nathan%20Perez-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Vy%20Nguyen-black"> <img alt="Aarian Ahsan" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Victoria%20Vynnychok-black">
```
You will attempt to fool machine learning models trained to detect political disinformation on Twitter using adversarial 
learning. An adversarial attack feeds a model seemingly normal input data (adversarial examples) which is actually 
designed to deceive the model into outputting an intended mistake. You will become involved with training the imitation 
(victim) and attacker models, data scraping additional training datasets from Twitter posts, generating adversarial 
examples, and testing the deception attacks. This project aims to identify if political actors can bypass detection 
systems using adversarial learning to spread misinformation to fool public understanding of social media.
