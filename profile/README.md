ACM Research is a semester-long program designed for students who want to dive deeper into a subfield of computer science and the process of conducting novel research. This semester, there will be ten unique research projects with a UTD faculty member advising each project. While ACM Research is open to all undergraduates of any major who are interested in researching in a technical field, underclassmen (freshmen and sophomores) are encouraged to join so they can build some experience during their time at UTD for future research and job opportunities. Each team has a unique topic to research, and there are multitudes of different niches to explore.

### [Auditory Unveil: Decoding Emotions in Speech Through Deep Learning](https://github.com/ACM-Research/AuditoryUnveil-DecodingEmotionsInSpeech)
<a href="#"><img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Saanvi%20ABala-purple"></a><a href="#"> <img alt="Research Member"  src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-George%20Contreras-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Harper%20Wood-gray"> <img alt="Research Member"  src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Leila%20Igwegbe-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Oscar%20Lay-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Thejaswin%20Kumaran-gray">
```
This project focuses on using audio analysis techniques in combination with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect
emotions in speech. It's designed to provide a framework for understanding and recognizing emotions in spoken language, which has
practical applications in various fields, including human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and mental health monitoring.

### [Beyond Gaming: Exploring Interactive AI Virtual Streamers Using Neural Networks](https://github.com/ACM-Research/Baremetal_Programming)
 <a href="#"><img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Vaishnavi 'Vivi'%20Josyula-purple"> </a><a href="#"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Abbas%20Khawaja-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Jose%20Garcia-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Korbin%20Shulz-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sowresh%20Medhicherla-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Terrell%20Johnson-gray">
```
Streaming has become a popular form of online entertainment with AI streamers recently gaining traction.
In this project, you will combine multiple neural networks to create a virtual streamer who can play games,
interact with the chat, and create engaging content, among other aspects. Ultimately, you will deploy the streamer
to a streaming platform like Twitch.

### [Blockchain-Based Federated Learning on the Ethereum Platform](https://github.com/ACM-Research/CardiothoraciDiagnosisPublicRepository)
 <a href="#"><img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Rohan%20Dave-purple"> </a><a href="#"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Akshat%20Sharma-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Bryant%20Hargreaves-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Dhruv%20Bansal-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Timothy%20Naumov-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Viswaretas%20Kotra-gray">
```
Large model training demands immense computing power. Federated learning presents an innovative solution by leveraging
distributed devices instead of relying on a single machine. Blockchain's distinct properties form an ideal base for interactions
in this setup. You will learn the basics of deep learning and blockchain to implement federated learning using Ethereum.

### [Colored Image Translation with CycleGAN](https://github.com/ACM-Research/Image-Transfer)
 <a href="#"><img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Benjamin%20Bowers-purple"> </a><a href="#"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Nivedh%20Koya-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ompranay%20Yedluri-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ryan%20Joseph-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Saanvi%20Bala-gray">
```
Images that are used as training data for machine learning are often more effective if they use a specific color scheme, 
such as thermal coloring. Using CycleGAN, we will build a model that can convert a given photo from normal coloring to 
specific colorings that are more effective as training data.

### [DisinfoDeception: Using Adversarial Attacks to Deceive Political Disinformation Models on Twitter](https://github.com/ACM-Research/DisinfoDeception_public)
 <a href="#"><img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Christopher%20Back-purple"> </a><a href="#"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Jonathan%20Serrano-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Joseph%20Wright-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Nathan%20Perez-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Vy%20Nguyen-gray"> <img alt="Research Member" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Victoria%20Vynnychok-gray">
```
You will attempt to fool machine learning models trained to detect political disinformation on Twitter using adversarial 
learning. An adversarial attack feeds a model seemingly normal input data (adversarial examples) which is actually 
designed to deceive the model into outputting an intended mistake. You will become involved with training the imitation 
(victim) and attacker models, data scraping additional training datasets from Twitter posts, generating adversarial 
examples, and testing the deception attacks. This project aims to identify if political actors can bypass detection 
systems using adversarial learning to spread misinformation to fool public understanding of social media.

Diagnosing wrist fractures requires time-consuming specialized training. We will use leading computer vision 
algorithms for automated fracture detection.
